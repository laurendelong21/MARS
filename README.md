# Neural Multi-Hop Reasoning With Logical Rules on Biomedical Knowledge Graphs

Tensorflow implementation of the method PoLo from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10367).


<h2> Credits</h2>

This implementation is based on [Shehzaad Dhuliawala's repository](https://github.com/shehzaadzd/MINERVA), which contains the code for the paper [Go for a Walk and Arrive at the Answer - Reasoning over Paths in Knowledge Bases using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05851).

<h2> How To Run </h2>

The dependencies are specified in [ENV.yml](ENV.yml) as well as [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) The user can use either of the following to create
a virtual environment:

```
conda env create -n ENV_NAME --file ENV.yml
```

```
python3 -m venv env

source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're having operating system conflicts (typically due to `pracmln` installation), use the Docker image:

```
docker build -t laurendelong21/internship:0 - < Dockerfile

docker run -it --workdir /work --volume $HOME_DIR$/PoLo:/work --name polo_cont laurendelong21/internship:0 
/bin/bash

```


To run PoLo, use one of the config files or create your own. For an explanation of each hyperparameter, refer to the [README file in the configs folder](configs/README.md).

**Note**: The Hetionet graph is split into ```graph_triples.txt``` (no inverse triples) and ```graph_inverses.txt``` (inverse triples) because of the file size constraints on GitHub.
These two files **need to be combined into one file** (with the name ```graph.txt```) before running the code.

To do this, you have to create a file called ```graph.txt```, as explained above:
```
cat datasets/Hetionet/graph_triples.txt datasets/Hetionet/graph_inverses.txt > datasets/Hetionet/graph.txt
```

Then, change the permissions of the ```run.sh``` file:
```
chmod a+x ./run.sh
```

Then, run the command
```
./run.sh configs/${config_file}.sh
```


<h2> Data Format </h2>

<h5> Triple format </h5>

KG triples need to be written in the format ```subject predicate object```, with tabs as separators. Furthermore, PoLo uses inverse relations, so it is important to add the inverse triple for each fact in the KG. The prefix  ```_``` is used before a predicate to signal the inverse relation, e.g., the inverse triple for ```Germany hasCapital Berlin``` is ```Berlin _hasCapital Germany```.

<h5> File format </h5>

Datasets should have the following files:
```
dataset
    ├── train.txt
    ├── dev.txt
    ├── test.txt
    ├── graph.txt
    └── rules.txt
```

Where:

```train.txt``` contains all train triples.

```dev.txt``` contains all validation triples.

```test.txt``` contains all test triples.

```graph.txt``` contains all triples of the KG except for ```dev.txt```, ```test.txt```, the inverses of ```dev.txt```, and the inverses of ```test.txt```.

```rules.txt``` contains the rules as a dictionary, where the keys are the head relations. The rules for a specific relation are stored as a list of lists (sorted by decreasing confidence), where a rule is expressed as ```[confidence, head relation, body relation, ..., body relation]```.

For Hetionet, the complete graph is split into ```graph_triples.txt``` (no inverse triples) and ```graph_inverses.txt``` (inverse triples) because of the file size constraints on GitHub.

For rules learned by the method [AnyBURL](http://web.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/AnyBURL/), the script [preprocess_rule_list.py](https://github.com/liu-yushan/PoLo/blob/main/mycode/data/preprocessing_scripts/preprocess_rule_list.py) can be used to preprocess the rules into the format that is needed for PoLo.

Finally, two vocab files are needed, one for the entities and one for the relations. These can be created by using the [```create_vocab.py``` file](mycode/data/preprocessing_scripts/create_vocab.py).
